    <div><p>Pharmacy ethics encompasses a set of moral principles and standards that guide pharmacists in their professional practice. It emphasizes the importance of patient well-being, confidentiality, and the responsible dispensing of medications. Pharmacists are entrusted with the critical role of ensuring the safe and effective use of medications, and ethical considerations play a pivotal role in their decision-making process. This includes respecting patient autonomy, maintaining confidentiality, and avoiding conflicts of interest. Pharmacy ethics underscores the commitment of pharmacists to act in the best interests of their patients and to uphold the integrity and reputation of the pharmacy profession.</p></div>
